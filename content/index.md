## About

An Englishman, an Italian, and an Austrian walk into a bar... Sounds like the start of a bad joke, right? 

Wrong. It’s the start of a epic band! Ladies and gentlemen, you’re about to witness a musical concoction that could only come from blending tea, espresso, and schnitzel into one glorious sound.

On drums, the Englishman- a rhythm machine with the precision of Big Ben and the energy of a Friday night at the pub.

On guitar and vocals, the Italian- a rock 'n' roll virtuoso whose riffs are as fiery as his espresso and whose voice is smoother than a gondola ride at sunset.

And on bass—and also taking the mic when the mood strikes—the Austrian- bringing low-end thunder and riffs that could shake the Alps.
